        Absolute difference between two integer numbers A and B is the difference of the larger 
        between A and B minus the smaller between A and B. Examples:
            •	Absolute difference between 5 and 1 is 4 (5 – 1 = 4).
            •	Absolute difference between -2 and -2 is 0 (-2 – -2 = 0).
            •	Absolute difference between 1 and 4 is 3 (4 – 1 = 3).
        If you are given a list of numbers, the sequence of absolute differences of the given list 
        is constructed by taking all absolute differences between all two consecutive numbers. Examples:
            •	In the list “0 1 2 3 5” it’s sequence of absolute differences is “1 1 1 2”
            	011121325
            •	In the list “-2 -2 -1 0 2 4 1 5” it’s sequence of absolute differences is “0 1 1 2 2 3 4”
            	-20-21-11022243145
            •	In the list “3 2 4 8” it’s sequence of absolute differences is “1 2 4”
            	3122448
        Increasing sequence is a zero-based sequence of numbers (called seq) in which the absolute 
        difference between every 2 consecutive numbers is 0 or 1 and for every i (from 1 to N-1) 
        seq[i-1]<=seq[i]. Examples:
            •	“1 1 2 2” is increasing sequence because 1<=1<=2<=2 and
            	1011202
            •	“0 1 1 2 2 3 4” is increasing sequence because 0<=1<=1<=2<=2<=3<=4 and
            	0110112021314
            •	“1 2 1” is NOT increasing sequence because 2>1.
            	11211
            •	“1 2 4” is NOT increasing sequence because the absolute difference between numbers 2 and 4 is 2:
            	11224
        You are given sequences of numbers. For each sequence find if the sequence of absolute differences 
        in the given sequence is an increasing sequence or not. See examples below for clarification.
